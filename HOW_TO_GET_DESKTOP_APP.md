## üçé macOS Users - Simple Local Build

1. Download this project as ZIP from Replit
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `~/GameHub`)
3. Open Terminal in that folder
4. Run:
```bash

## ‚öôÔ∏è First Time Setup

When you launch the desktop app for the first time:

1. **Click the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** in the top-right
2. **Set your Steam installation path:**
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam`  
   - Linux: `~/.steam/steam` or `~/.local/share/Steam`
3. **Click Save**

---

## üéÆ How to Use

1. Browse DayZ servers in the list
2. Click **"Join Server"** on any server
3. The desktop app will:
   - ‚úÖ Check which mods you have installed
   - ‚úÖ Show which mods you're missing
   - ‚úÖ Let you download them via Steam (one click)
   - ‚úÖ Launch DayZ with all the right parameters

**No more manual mod management!**

---

## ‚ùì Why Can't You Build Windows from Replit?

Replit runs on Linux servers. Building Windows .exe files from Linux requires additional tools (Wine) that would take hours to set up. Building on your Windows PC is **faster and more reliable**.

The 3 PowerShell commands take about 2 minutes total, and then you have a portable .exe that works on any Windows PC!

## üöÄ What You're Getting

‚úÖ **Full desktop app with:**
- Automatic Steam Workshop mod detection
- One-click mod downloading
- Auto-launch DayZ with correct mods
- Same UI as the web version
- Persistent favorites and settings

‚úÖ **Portable versions:**
- No installation required
- Copy to USB drive
- Share with friends
- Works offline (after first setup)

---

## üìù Note About package.json

During the build process, the project's `package.json` file was modified. If you encounter any issues with the Replit environment, you can restore it manually or let me know and I can help troubleshoot.

---

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Make sure Steam is installed and running
2. Check that DayZ is installed
3. Verify the Steam path in Settings is correct
4. Try running PowerShell as Administrator (Windows)

The desktop app is fully functional - the only limitation is that you need to build the Windows version on your own PC, which is actually the standard way to distribute Electron apps anyway!
