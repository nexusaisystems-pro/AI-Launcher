## 🚀 How to Use It (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Configure Your GitHub Repository

Set the environment variable so downloads know where to fetch installers:

**In Replit (Recommended):**
1. Click the **Secrets** tool (🔒) in the left sidebar
2. Add new secret:
   - **Key:** `VITE_GITHUB_REPO`
   - **Value:** `yourusername/gamehub-launcher` (use your GitHub username)
3. Click "Add secret"
4. Restart your app

**Or create a `.env` file:**
```bash
VITE_GITHUB_REPO=yourusername/gamehub-launcher
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# If you haven't already
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions desktop app distribution"

# Create GitHub repo and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/gamehub-launcher.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create Your First Release

**On GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `GameHub Launcher v1.0.0`
5. Click "Publish release"

**That's it!** GitHub Actions will:
- Build Windows .exe (portable)
- Build macOS .dmg installer
- Build Linux .AppImage
- Upload them to your release page
- Make them available on your `/downloads` page

Takes ~5-10 minutes to complete.
